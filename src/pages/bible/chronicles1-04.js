                In Hebrew culture, the mother, with some few exceptions, always
                named the child. In that culture, the name was very important.
                If the Holy Spirit did not impress upon her the name that was to
                be given, as He sometimes did, she would name the child
                according to what she wanted him to be, or because of something
                that had happened in the family that was either a blessing or a
                curse [especially the boys]. This lady, in naming her little boy
                Jabez, which means he makes sorrow, either did not want him, or
                else felt she could not properly care for him; therefore, the
                child, by being given this name, would always be reminded of the
                negative circumstances of his birth. This severe hindrance could
                have turned him toward bitterness, which would have destroyed
                him, or toward God. Jabez allowed it to turn him toward God.

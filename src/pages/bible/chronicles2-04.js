                (This represents death and Resurrection. In a sense, there must
                be a death to the old self, with the new self raised in the
                identification of Christ. This means that all former identity
                for the Believer must be lost; what we were before Salvation is
                of no consequence. Truly, the Holy Spirit is making a new
                creature, which can only be carried out by our understanding
                that we are baptized into His death, buried with Him by baptism
                into death, and raised with Him in newness of life [

                and the brass, had to be melted, which means they lost their old
                identity, and then fashioned into a new mold, in order to be of
                fit use for the Temple. This is a picture of what the Spirit of
                God does with us, which is carried out by and through the Cross

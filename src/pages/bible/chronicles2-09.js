                (The fact that God did not record the great sins of Solomon in
                his latter years is some indication that Solomon asked for and
                received Mercy, Forgiveness, and Grace. If so, these sins would
                have been washed away, and thereby unrecorded. This is about the
                only indication that we have that Solomon may have made things
                right with God before he died.)

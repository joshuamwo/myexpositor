                an ongoing Saviour, the Lord smote him with leprosy. On the
                forehead of the High Priest was a golden plate with the words,
                Holiness to the Lord; on the forehead of Uzziah was sinfulness
                [leprosy]. We must ever remember that Christ is the Source of
                all things, as it pertains to the Believer, and the Cross is the
                Means by which all of these things come to us. If we attempt to
                obtain anything from the Lord by means other than the Cross, we
                have, in effect, like Uzziah, claimed to be our own Saviour.)

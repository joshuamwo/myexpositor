                of his father, he did not associate with the Temple at all. If
                this be so, then Uzziah, Jotham, and Ahaz illustrate how
                incurably diseased is the natural heart. The first king boldly
                intrudes into the Temple, the second timidly stands away from
                it, and the third shuts it up.)

                never been a perfect man; all, even when diligently trying to

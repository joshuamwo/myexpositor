                Every evidence seems to point to the fact that the Lord tried to
                warn him; however, we can certainly understand Josiah paying no
                attention at all to a heathen who claimed to hear from God. He
                didnt and neither would we; therefore, with so little

                Despite Josiahs reforms, Judah, at heart, had little turned to
                the Lord; consequently, the Lord would take Josiah away, simply
                because it was time for Judgment to come. Isaiah said, possibly
                concerning such as this: The righteous perishes, and no man lays
                it to heart: and merciful men are taken away, none considering
                that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come [

                gold in the 18th year of his reign, about a year before he
                burned Jerusalem [586 B.C.]. Daniel and his friends had been in
                Babylon now for nearly 20 years. The erection of this image was
                approximately 15 years after the events of the dream and its
                interpretation. This illustrates the darkness and incurable
                rebellion of the natural heart. It proves that, apart from a new
                Spiritual Birth, no circumstances, however powerful, can teach
                man to know and worship God.)

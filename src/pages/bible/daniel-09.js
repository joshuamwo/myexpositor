                The third block of time, which we will study in the last Verse,
                will be the last week of years, totaling seven years, which will
                make up the Great Tribulation period, concluding Daniels

                Again, it must be remembered that these 490 years did not run
                consecutively. There were stoppages, as stated, in the first 49
                years; then there has been a huge halt of nearly 2,000 years
                from the time that Christ was crucified, which has not concluded
                yet. In other words, the last week of years [seven years] is yet
                to come.)

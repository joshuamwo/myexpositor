                (As stated, Israel had to try; however, no man except Christ was
                fully able to keep the Law; consequently, they were to fall back
                on the Sacrificial System, and what it represented, namely
                Christ and the Cross. Righteousness has never come to anyone
                except by Faith, and that refers to Faith in Christ [

                the simple fact of their effort to keep the Commandments, which
                meant that their faith was in themselves instead of the Lord.
                The modern Church has the same problem.)

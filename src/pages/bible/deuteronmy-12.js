          Offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the Altar of the LORD your
          God: and the blood of your sacrifices shall be poured out upon the

                (This Scripture points to the fact as to why the blood is so
                sacred. The Altar represented the Cross, and the blood typified
                the poured out Life of the Son of God, Who would give Himself
                for the Redemption of humanity. Original sin passes down to man
                through the blood, which is the life of the flesh; consequently,
                the entirety of the human race is polluted and sick with sin.
                The only remedy, and thank God there is a remedy, is the shed
                Blood of Jesus Christ, Whose Blood was Perfect, because He was
                not born of natural procreation, but was conceived in the womb
                of Mary by the decree of the Holy Spirit; as well, He lived a
                Perfect, unsullied, unspotted Life, totally without sin.
                Therefore, He could go to the Cross as a Perfect Sacrifice, and
                when His Blood was shed, it atoned for all sin, past, present,
                and future, at least for all who will believe [

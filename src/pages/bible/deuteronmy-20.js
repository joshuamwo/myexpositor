                Even though this Promise was addressed to a nation, it holds
                true for modern Believers, as well, as it regards spiritual
                warfare; however, the warfare in which every Christian must
                engage, and it is incumbent upon all, can be engaged
                successfully only if we function according to Gods prescribed
                order. That order is: Christ is always the Source of all things
                which come from God. The Cross is the Means by which it is given
                to us. This means that we must ever make the Cross the object of
                our Faith, and not allow it to be moved anywhere else. This
                done, the Holy Spirit, Who works conclusively within the
                Finished Work of Christ, will work on our behalf, guaranteeing
                victory within our lives. In this way, and this way only, can
                victory be won and maintained [

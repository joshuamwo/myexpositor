                only be given to the Gentile, to whom the Lord had committed

                displaying Himself, shaped public affairs in their interests.
                They had lost all title to His Protection and, therefore, it is
                an extremely important and comforting study to observe in this

                not to let the Name of God appear in the Book, though it lies
                concealed in the Hebrew Text.

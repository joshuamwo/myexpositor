          , that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court
          of the kings house, over against the kings house: and the king sat
          upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of the
          house{" "}

          <sup className="calibre7">2</sup>And it was so, when the king saw
          Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favour in
          his sight: and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was
          in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre{" "}

              <span className="calibre_19">

          will you, queen Esther? and what is your request? it shall be even
          given you to the half of the kingdom.
        </span>

      <p className="calibre_21">
        <span className="bold1">
          <sup className="calibre7">4</sup>And Esther answered, If it seem good
          unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet
          that I have prepared for him.{" "}
          <span className="italic1">
            <span>
              <span className="calibre_19">
                (Concerning this, Williams says, Esthers intelligence and tact
                were admirable. Her life and that of her people hung on a
                thread. She was playing with edged tools, and the slightest
                mistake would have been fatal. To invite the king to a banquet
                was a master-stroke of policy; and to include his favorite
                minister, Haman, in the invitation was not only an added
                evidence of skill and of a deep knowledge of human nature, but
                it was, at the same time, a clever plan for getting Haman into
                her power. No doubt, the Lord had told her exactly what to do.)

      <p className="calibre_21">
        <span className="bold1">
          <sup className="calibre7">5</sup>Then the king said, Cause Haman to
          make haste, that he may do as Esther has said. So the king and Haman
          came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="calibre_21">
        <span className="bold1">
          <sup className="calibre7">6</sup>And the king said unto Esther at the
          banquet of wine, What is your petition? and it shall be granted you:
          and what is your request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be
          performed{" "}

                (the king sensed that Esther had something more in mind than
                what was now being done; he knew that she must have a request, a
                real favor that she wants him to grant; therefore, he repeats
                the inquiry and the promise that he had made previously)

      <p className="calibre_21">
        <span className="bold1">
          <sup className="calibre7">7</sup>Then answered Esther, and said, My
          petition and my request is;

      </p>
      <p className="calibre_21">
        <span className="bold1">
          <sup className="calibre7">8</sup>If I have found favour in the sight
          of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to
          perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I
          shall prepare for them, and I will do tomorrow as the king has said.{" "}
          <span className="italic1">
            <span>
              <span className="calibre_19">
                (I will make known tomorrow my actual request. The repetition of
                her invitation showed extraordinary wisdom. At the first
                banquet, the king rightly divined that some important matter lay
                behind the invitation; else, why should Esther risk her life by
                coming uninvited into his presence? It was surely not merely to
                invite him and Haman to a dinner. Esther, by repeating the
                invitation and postponing the secret petition, enhanced its
                importance while, at the same time, she increased her personal
                interest in the kings affections and more deeply excited his
                curiosity. Furthermore, she more effectually threw Haman off his
                guard and so secured his fall.)

          and with a glad heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the kings gate,
          that he stood not up, nor moved for him, he was full of indignation
          against Mordecai{" "}

            <span>
              <span className="calibre_19">

              <span className="calibre_19">
                (it was a plot to know what to do with Mordecai; in other words,
                killing would not be enough; he wanted his death to be a
                spectacle)

          his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things
          wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above
          the princes and servants of the king.

          the king.

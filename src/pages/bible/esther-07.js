                slaves, the kings revenues would have been injured beyond

                sought to grasp her feet or her garments, as was usual with
                supplicants in the east. At that moment, the king returned.
                Misunderstanding Hamans action, or pretending to do so, the king
                accused Haman of attacking the queen. At that moment, at the
                kings command, guards standing nearby covered Hamans face, which
                meant that he was doomed.

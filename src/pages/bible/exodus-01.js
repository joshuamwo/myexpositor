                (While Pharaoh desired to weaken the Israelites by demanding
                that the boy babies be killed at birth, Satans plan was far more
                sinister. This is the serpents enmity against the Seed of the
                woman. If this could have been carried out concerning the male
                children being destroyed, there would have been no David, just
                to name one instance, and, if no David, no Davids Son. There is
                no record that the Israelites obeyed this injunction concerning
                the river. In fact, God used the river, even as we shall see, to
                bring about His Divine Will.)

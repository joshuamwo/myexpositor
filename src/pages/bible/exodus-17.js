                portrays the fact that our own efforts soon result in spiritual
                burn-out. But once we are in Gods glorious way [sitting on the
                Stone], the victory is ours. Aaron was a Type of Christ as our
                Great High Priest, and Hur, whose name means light, speaks to us
                of the Holy Spirit. This is the help afforded the Child of God.

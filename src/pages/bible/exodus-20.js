                All were to observe this day. Everything pertaining to the Law
                of Moses, in some way, spoke of Christ. The Sabbath was no
                exception. It was meant to portray the fact that there is rest
                in Christ and, in fact, that there is rest only in Christ [

                effect keeping the Sabbath, which speaks of the rest that we
                have in Christ rest from self-effort to attain unto
                Righteousness. Even though there was no written command by the
                Holy Spirit to do so, gradually we find Believers, during the
                time of the Early Church, as recorded in the Book of Acts,
                making Sunday, the first day of the week, the day of our Lords
                Resurrection, their day of worship, etc., which is different
                than the Sabbath of old, because Christ has fulfilled in
                totality the old Jewish Sabbath.)

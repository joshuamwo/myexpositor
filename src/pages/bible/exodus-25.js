                given us a detailed description of the Tabernacle, its
                structure, furniture, and Priesthood. When we consider, and
                understand, that more space is devoted to the account of the
                Tabernacle than to any other single object or subject treated in
                the Bible, we then begin to understand its vast significance. It
                took but two Chapters to portray the record of Gods Work in
                creating this Earth, and fitting it for human habitation. By
                comparison, some 12 Chapters are needed to tell us about the
                Tabernacle.

                (It is only above the Blood-stained Mercy Seat that God will
                meet with sinful human beings, because thats the only place that
                He can meet with sinful human beings, and not malign His
                Righteousness and Holiness. Concerning this, Mackintosh says:
                Thus it is that the soul of the believing sinner finds peace. He
                sees that Gods Righteousness and His Justification rest upon
                precisely the same basis, namely Christs accomplished Work. When
                man, under the powerful action of the Truth of God, takes his
                place as a sinner, God can, in the exercise of Grace, take His
                place as a Saviour, and then every question is settled, for the
                Cross having answered all the claims of Divine Justice, Mercys
                copious streams can flow unhindered. When a Righteous God and a
                ruined sinner meet on a Blood-sprinkled platform, all is settled
                forever settled in such a way as perfectly glorifies God, and
                eternally saves the sinner.)

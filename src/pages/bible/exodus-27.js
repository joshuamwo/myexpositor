                (This Altar of indestructible wood was to be overlaid with
                copper. Until the metallurgy of the not-too-distant past, copper
                had a greater resistance to fire, even than gold or silver. It
                would consequently protect the wood, that it would not catch
                fire and be consumed. Pink says: The copper plates on the Altar
                protected it from the fervent heat and prevented it from being
                burned up; so Christ passed through the fires of Gods wrath
                without being consumed. He is mighty to save, because He was
                mighty to endure.)

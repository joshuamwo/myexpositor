                the Messiah as the Branch, that is, as the Author of Life.
                Satans parody of this was the Asherah the Greek Phallus [a mans
                reproductive organ]. The ancients, in their efforts to reach
                back to the origin of life and worship it as a god, arrived at
                the lowest depth of moral and intellectual degradation by the

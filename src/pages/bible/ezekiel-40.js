                of God in His People. He will rebuild His Sanctuary among them;
                and He has informed them of this fact, and of its details, as a
                testimony of His Faithful Love, and as a Message to their hearts
                and consciences. Therefore, the Prophet was commanded to show

                anything that could be brought to it. Consequently, this fact
                illustrates a great Spiritual Truth. In this building and its
                dependencies, the measurements of foundations and the posts have
                great importance; for the one word expresses stability, the
                other, permanence.

                in the massive stone door-posts of the Egyptian Temples. If,

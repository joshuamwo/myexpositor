                The idea of this Verse is: Such Offerings as specified here were
                for the Priests only, and thereby, typified their personal
                worship of the Lord. This also typified that even though they
                were Gods Chosen, and even Priests, still, they were sinners
                and, therefore, desperately needing a Saviour.)

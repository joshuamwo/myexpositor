                Ham and Canaan were not black; some were white, and we speak of
                those who occupied the land of Canaan. The evidence is, it was
                only upon those, and because they opposed Israel, hence the
                statement being Cursed be Canaan. Even then, Canaanites who
                placed their faith in God could escape it. Rahab, a Canaanite
                and a harlot, is an excellent example. She placed her faith in
                God and after a period of purification, was brought into Israels
                camp. She married an Israelite, and became an ancestress of
                David, and even the greater Son of David, the Lord Jesus Christ

                (With the entire family leaving Ur of the Chaldees, and
                journeying toward Canaan, we know that by now Abraham has had
                the great Revelation from God. How this Revelation came to him,
                we arent told! The entire family goes with Abraham, which seems
                to not have been the Will of God.)

                toward the south country should have taught him never again to
                move in that direction. But man, as such, never learns nor can
                learn spiritual lessons. We will find here that sin is just as
                hateful in a man of God as in a man of the world, and its guilt
                is greater. Abraham must have been deeply shocked at the power
                of unbelief in his nephew Lot, but was he equally shocked at the
                power of evil in himself, as this Chapter records?)

                Because of Abrahams abandonment of the path of Faith, and for as

                illustrates a spiritual reality in Christian experience. It is
                not unreasonable to learn from all this that the birth of
                spiritual children in the Gospel is hindered or delayed by the
                inconsistent conduct of Believers Williams.)

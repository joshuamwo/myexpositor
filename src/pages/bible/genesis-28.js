                of sheep and cattle to the Lord as a Sacrifice. If that, in
                fact, was the case, we now find Jacob offering up Sacrifices to
                a degree as no one else. If the tithe which we propose to give
                to the Lord doesnt advance the grand Message of Jesus Christ and

                occasion of tithing mentioned in the Bible was when Abraham paid
                tithes to Melchizedek, who was a Type of Christ as our Great
                High Priest. Jesus would become this by dying on the Cross as a
                Sacrifice [

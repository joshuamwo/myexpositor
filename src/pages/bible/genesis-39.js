                the wrongdoing of his brothers condoned by the Lord, still, the
                Lord was in all of this; even though Joseph did not know what
                the future held, he maintained his Faith in the Lord, thereby
                walking by Faith instead of by sight. Had he done otherwise, the
                Lord could not have blessed him. Many Christians forfeit
                blessing, simply because they refuse to humble themselves before
                the Lord. Joseph could easily have grown bitter, until the
                bitterness overtook him. But he put it all in the Hands of his

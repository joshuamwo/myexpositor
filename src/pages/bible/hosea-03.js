                that is to be taken by the Prophet, this one perhaps even more
                severe than the first. The short phrase, Go yet, means that the

                That which will now be portrayed, even though painfully
                executed, will nevertheless portray the Love of God in a fashion

                The Command of the Lord to Hosea is to love a woman beloved of
                her friend, yet an adulteress. The idea of the entirety of this
                scenario is that Gomer, who was an adulteress, and which
                symbolized the idolatry of Israel, proved faithless to the
                Prophet and fell into degraded bondage. Nevertheless, Hosea was
                commanded still to love her, to redeem her from slavery, to
                remain faithful to her for a lengthened period, and then to
                fully restore her.

                The phrase, Beloved of her friend, is striking indeed! It means
                that Gomer was loved by Hosea, but she had forfeited by her
                misconduct the right to use the honorable words of wife and
                husband. Therefore, the word friend instead would be used,
                because she was yet an adulteress.)

                barley marked the worthlessness of this slave. No one can fully
                understand the pain and suffering evidenced in the words, So I
                bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver. Gomer was now

                One can only guess at the hurt that filled Hoseas heart as he
                stood before Gomer. She was no doubt dressed in rags and had
                been reduced by abuse to less than a slave. She must have
                reasoned, How could he love me after all this?

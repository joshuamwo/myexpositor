                coming future day when Israels Repentance will be hid, which
                means bound up and noted carefully by God, exactly as her sins
                had once been hid or bound up. Now sins are replaced by
                Repentance. As a result, this Repentance causes the sins to be
                washed away and, therefore, hidden from Gods Eyes. It is called
                Justification by Faith.)

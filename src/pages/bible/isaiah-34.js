                here. The idea of this Passage is that on this particular site,
                wherever it may be [probably where Babylon once existed], the
                sounds that come from it will be debilitating, to say the least.
                The screeching and crying will characterize the horror of
                eternal Hell, which it represents [

                Many may ask the question, Why would the Lord have such a place
                or opening to Hell in the Earth? Perhaps the purpose of this
                opening will be to cause coming generations to abhor sin and its
                consequences. When natural men can actually see into eternal
                Hell, it will be a great warning to them to walk in the Ways of
                God. Not only men on the New Earth, but Angels also, and all
                other beings will be able to look into this place and see how

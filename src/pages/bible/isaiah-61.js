                When Jesus died on the Cross, He atoned for all sin. Upon Faith
                in Him, He took down the list of all our sins, doubled it over,
                where these sins could no longer be seen, and wrote His Name on
                the front, meaning that all the indebtedness was settled;
                therefore, every single Believer in the world has the privilege
                of possessing the double.)

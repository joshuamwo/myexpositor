                A city not forsaken, characterizes the Jerusalem of so many
                centuries. It was forsaken by God, because Jerusalem had
                forsaken Him! Now they have accepted Him; therefore, it is A
                city not forsaken, meaning that God has placed His approval upon
                it, by making it the capital of Planet Earth, and the domicile
                of the Saviour.)

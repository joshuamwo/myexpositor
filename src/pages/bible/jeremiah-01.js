                (This was fulfilled approximately thirty-five years later. The
                word against occurs eight times in this Chapter. This emphasizes
                the fact that man is estranged from God. Scriptural teaching is,
                therefore, opposed to human teaching. Doctrines which appeal to
                the natural heart, and which are in harmony with the assured
                results of modern thought, must, therefore, be false; for the
                natural mind is enmity against God, and is not appealed to by
                Divine teaching [

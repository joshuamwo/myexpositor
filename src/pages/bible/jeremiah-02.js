                (Israel was a son, not a slave, yet they were about to become
                slaves! In fact, Israel had become a servant, i.e., slave, to
                the heathenistic gods. As a result, they would soon become a
                slave to a foreign power.

                The question, Is he a homeborn slave?, is interesting indeed! It
                has reference to an animal in a zoo. An animal was made by God
                to be free and unfettered. However, if born in a zoo and knowing
                nothing but the confines of such, it is a slave without really
                knowing it. Such was Israel, and such are so many modern

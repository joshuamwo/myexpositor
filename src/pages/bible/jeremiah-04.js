          <sup className="calibre7">31</sup>For I have heard a voice as of a
          woman in travail, and the anguish as of her who brings forth her first
          child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, who bewails herself, who
          spreads her hands, saying, Woe is me now! for my soul is wearied
          because of murderers.{" "}

                (Thus, Zions soul fainted before the murderers, i.e., the
                Babylonians. The woman in travail is Jerusalem, who weeps over
                her destruction and the slaughter of her inhabitants. The Holy
                Spirit likens it to birth pains, but, in reality, it will be
                death pains. Her cry is, Woe is me now! At any time, she could
                have said, Forgive me now, and the prayer would have been
                instantly answered, and this catastrophe avoided!)

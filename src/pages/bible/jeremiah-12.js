                (The sense of this Verse is: Judah thought surely they were
                sowing wheat, regarding their man-made religious worship. In
                their minds, they were appeasing Jehovah, especially by
                continuing to offer Sacrifices along with the Temple ritual, as
                well as the other gods by their idol worship. They had also
                constructed for themselves a fall-back position by looking to
                Egypt. It was all man-devised and, therefore, God-rejected!

                , Nimrod founded Babylon as his capital. The name Babylon comes
                from the Hebrew word Babel, and was derived from the action of
                the Lord in confounding their language. Babel means confusion,
                which had to do with the confusion of languages, but more so
                with the confusion of man tendered by the Fall. Therefore,
                Babylon, throughout its history, became a symbol of the pride of
                man in his inevitable Fall.)

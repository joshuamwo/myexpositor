                not symbolize an unconverted, but a converted, man. It was
                necessary that one of Gods children should be chosen for this
                trial; for the subject of the Book is not the conversion of the
                sinner, but the consecration of the Saint. It is evident that an

                that a man who feared God, who was perfect, and who hated evil

                We find in this Book that God uses Satan, calamity, and sickness
                to be His instruments in creating character and making men
                partakers of His Holiness. Such were the instruments; but the
                Hand that used them was Gods; and the facts of this Book explain
                to Christian people, who, like Job, are conscious of personal
                integrity, why calamities, sorrows, and diseases are permitted
                to afflict them.)

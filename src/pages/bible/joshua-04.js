                (Four facts are stated about these stones. They were taken, they
                were carried, they were laid down, and they were set up. The
                origin of the stones was the deep bed of Jordan; their purpose
                was to testify that Israel owed her entrance into the goodly
                land only and wholly to Divine Grace and Power. In the Baptism
                of Christ, the Believer dies to his old life and rises into a
                New Life; and we are reminded that, as to our moral origin, we
                were buried beneath the waters of the Wrath of God; that, as to
                our present position, we are now set up upon Resurrection
                ground; and it is our duty to testify daily to the Glory of
                Christ, the one and only Saviour. The Lord Jesus Christ said to
                the Pharisees that if the children were silent, the very stones
                would cry out! These stones set up at Gilgal cried out day and
                night!)

          Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of
          Jordan, as the LORD spoke unto Joshua, according to the number of the
          Tribes of the Children of Israel, and carried them over with them unto
          the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.

                stones, but these spoken of in this Ninth Verse must be referred
                to as Wilderness stones. These twelve stones buried on the
                bottom of the Jordan River, where the feet of the Priests had
                stood, signify the death and burial of Israels forty years of
                unbelief and sinning in the Wilderness. The Lord is saying to
                Israel that that time is over, buried, out of sight, and
                forgotten, typical of all our sins of the past, that is, if we

                delight in diving down to the bottom of Jordan, spiritually
                speaking, and retrieving those stones and bringing them to the
                surface, thereby constantly reminding people of such-and-such
                sin. I would hope we could see the terrible insult to Christ
                that such a thing is, and, in fact, that such action is sinful
                and wicked. Sins forgiven are to never be held over someones

                on others, they must themselves feel its sharpness and die
                beneath its stroke. This was illustrated in Circumcision, which
                in essence is a Type of the Cross. Separation was made and blood
                was shed. We as Believers are to be separated from the world,
                and this can only be done by looking to Christ and the Cross,

                learn that all his goodness must be slain with the Sword of the
                Lord just as much as all his badness. But to the true Believer,
                this is most sweet; for it brings him into a Resurrection life,
                and the power of that life takes all strength from Satan. Man,

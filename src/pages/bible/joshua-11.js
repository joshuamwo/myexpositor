                the seat of government, so that it should be that for God which
                before it had been for the world. But God will in no wise allow

                People were to depend exclusively on Him, and to dwell with Him
                at Gilgal. Accordingly, Hazor is totally destroyed. Not a
                vestige of its former power must remain to compete with Gilgal.

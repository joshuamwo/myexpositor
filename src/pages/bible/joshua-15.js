                However, a life of blessing with God has definite borders, just
                as the lot of Judah had its Divinely marked boundaries. It is
                important that God should choose a lot in life for each one of
                His People, and that we not choose such a lot ourselves, and
                that we be satisfied with what God gives us. But, one of the
                problems is that far too many Believers, not satisfied with what
                God has given them, seek to enlarge their borders of their own
                volition, which God will never honor. And yet, the Lord, at
                times, does stretch our Faith, even as He did that of Othniel,
                which can claim added blessings; however, the Holy Spirit, in
                such a case, will always inform the Believer, which means that

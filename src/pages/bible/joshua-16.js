                vestige of evil must be destroyed in our lives. It is not enough
                that we merely have victory over the weakness, whatever it might
                be. The weakness itself, and in every capacity, must be removed.
                This can be done only by the Believer understanding that
                everything comes to us through Christ and the Cross, which
                demands that the Cross ever be the Object of our Faith. And, as
                weve said over and over again, the Holy Spirit will then help us
                grandly, thereby performing the work as it needs to be
                performed, and which only He can do [

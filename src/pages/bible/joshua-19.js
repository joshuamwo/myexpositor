                particular city, and the Lord said that he could have it.
                Timnath means the portion that remains, while Serah means city
                of the Sun. This could well be symbolic of the Baptism with the
                Holy Spirit, i.e., the portion that remains. As well, Serah
                could typify the life that flows from the Spirit, as it flows
                from the Sun.)

                Israel; He employed others to do such; however, it was all done
                with the decorum of proper proceedings. The fact that God
                decided the portion for each Tribe effectually prevented any
                challenge as to the justness of the distribution. From this, the
                lesson may be learned that the right way is to allow the Lord to
                choose for us, instead of us choosing for ourselves.)

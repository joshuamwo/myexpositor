                An altar, which was the product of mans imagination, rebellious
                imagination we might quickly add, was set up close to Bezer.
                This neutralized it as a city of refuge. Why? God has but one
                center of Atonement and Blessing in Type, and that is Calvary.
                Any other center, even an exact pattern, denies that Divine
                Center. Bezers sufficiency as a refuge was based upon the
                atoning sacrifices at Shiloh, as was everything else in Israel.
                The erection of the Reubenite altar destroyed that sufficiency,
                because it destroyed that base.

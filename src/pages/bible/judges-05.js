                When the Holy Spirit begins to do a certain thing, and Believers
                take a neutral position, they lose the manifestation and the
                experience of the Power of God. But if, like these people of
                Meroz, they are so placed that they can help, but refuse to do
                so, then they bring death upon their souls.)

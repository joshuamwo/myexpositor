                His Death, in the giving of Himself as a Perfect Sacrifice,
                which will atone for the sins of man. Gideons action proclaims
                the fact that he based everything on the atoning Sacrifice.
                Faith in that Sacrifice, and what it represented, is the primary
                reason that the Lord chose Gideon. Faith in the atoning Work of
                Christ is the only Faith that God will recognize. Regrettably,

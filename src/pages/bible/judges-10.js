                accepted after a slight struggle, and then, after a time, the

                The confession we have sinned against You showed true
                Repentance, for it showed a sense of injury done to God, and not

                Remorse is not repentance mental distress because of the painful
                results of sin is not repentance; but a sense of the grief and
                dishonor occasioned to God, and sorrow because He has been
                sinned against, that is Repentance. David and Simon Magus
                illustrate true and false repentance. The one cried out, I have
                sinned against the Lord. His first thought was God and His
                Glory. The other said, Pray for me that none of these things
                come upon me. His first thought was himself and to secure

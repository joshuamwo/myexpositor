                fall at any moment from the position of whole-hearted separation
                unto God into all that in which the world finds its joy and
                strength. We find here that while God made use of Samsons
                marriage to a Philistine in order to punish that people, still,
                that did not excuse Samsons folly and disobedience. The Law of

                recognized in his action toward Israel in connection with the
                Philistines. The other nations mightily oppressed Israel, but it
                is not stated that the Philistines did so. They simply ruled
                Israel; and so insensible had Israel become to slavery that they
                accepted this yoke. This is the sad history of many a Christian
                life. Bondage to some inward form of evil is submitted to, its
                rule accepted, and spiritual insensibility results.

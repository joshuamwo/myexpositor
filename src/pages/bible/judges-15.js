                completely the Philistine yoke was fastened upon the necks of
                Judah. The opposition of the world is bitter to the Nazarite
                Christian, but the opposition of the Church is more bitter. The
                Philistines ruled over Israel, and Israel was content to have it
                so. They did not wish to have a Nazarite in their midst who
                would disturb their peace and excite the world against them.
                They were quite ready to hand Samson over to a cruel death in
                order to maintain their so-called peace. This condition of
                spiritual degradation marks, and has marked, the history of the
                Christian Church. Instead of hailing Samson as a deliverer, the
                Israelites treated him as an enemy.

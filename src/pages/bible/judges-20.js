                of the Lamb. The Nation at last draws near to God in Repentance
                and sorrow, confessing themselves to be sinners. As interpreted
                by the New Testament, they confessed their own guilt, they
                declared themselves worthy of the Wrath of God, and they pleaded
                the Person and Work of Christ, the Lamb of God, for pardon and
                acceptance; their souls now humbled and taught, they were in a
                fit moral state to go up against Gibeah. It indeed deserved
                wrath, and will receive that wrath, but Israel merited wrath
                herself, and had, in a figure, to suffer it in and with Christ
                before drawing the sword against Benjamin.

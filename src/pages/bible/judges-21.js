                (As should be obvious, the lessons of this Book are painful, but
                yet necessary. These lessons teach us that our Faith must ever
                be registered in Christ and what He has done for us at the
                Cross. That being done, the Holy Spirit will have latitude
                within our lives. To be sure, prayer and the study of the Word
                will then become prominent within our experience. Let it ever be
                understood that no height of Christian experience, nor
                miraculous manifestations, as glorious as they might be, can
                keep the soul from falling. Only daily fellowship with God,
                meditation upon and obedience to His Holy Word, and the
                ever-present Power of the indwelling Holy Spirit, which can only
                come about, as stated, by Faith in Christ and the Cross, can

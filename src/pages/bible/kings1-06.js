                (The 480 year number given in the Text has been debated for many
                centuries. It is virtually impossible to tally up the years of
                the Judges, considering that the possibility exists that some of
                these times overlapped. I personally feel that the number 480
                years is correct as stated, but with the following variations:

                This Verse illustrates the Promise that God not only forgives
                sin, but also forgets sin. Thus, the years of Israels bondage to
                the nations are omitted. The lesson, at the same time, is taught
                that years or days spent in bondage to the world are forever
                lost. Thus, what appears to be a chronological error in the
                Sacred Text is found to be a designed Message of comfort and
                warning.

                It is doubtful that the 480 years stated in the Text include the
                whole period of time between the Exodus and the fourth year of
                Solomons reign. It really refers to the 480th year of the
                security of Israel as a Nation. It does not include the 40 years
                of Sinai and the wandering in the wilderness, the period of the
                conquest of Canaan and division of the land [about 10 years], or
                the three years of confusion under Abimelech and the 111 years
                of servitude during the Judges.

                It is believed that the entire period from the Exodus to the
                fourth year of Solomon was approximately 645 years. However, as
                stated, there is a possibility that some of the periods of the
                Judges overlapped with other periods, which could shorten the
                entirety of the time by a number of years.

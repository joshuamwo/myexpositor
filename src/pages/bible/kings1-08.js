                a year would lapse between the completion of the Temple and its
                dedication. This great event would occur in the Year of Jubilee,
                during the Feast of Tabernacles, and in connection with the
                Great Day of Atonement. The Feast of Trumpets, which was a type
                in Jewish history of the Rapture of the Church, would be
                extended to last for some seven days. This would be followed by

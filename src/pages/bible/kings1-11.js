                presents the last statement made by the Holy Spirit about
                Solomon personally. The next fact records his death. Did he
                repent at the end? The Scripture doesnt say. We can only hope
                that the writer of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Solomon
                definitely did make his way back to God. There is some small
                evidence that he did, which we will address in II Chronicles.)

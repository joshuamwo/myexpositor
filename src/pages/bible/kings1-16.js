                the fulfilling of the Prophecy given to Joshua, the son of Nun.
                Ignoring or despising the Bible, Hiel moves against the
                prediction of Joshua given some 500 years before and rebuilds
                the walls which the judgment of God had thrown down. Upon laying
                the foundations, his oldest son is smitten with death. It also
                seems that his youngest son died whenever the wall was finished.
                Ahab should have learned from this how vain and how deadly are
                the results of opposing God.)

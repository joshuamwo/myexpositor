                to the Prophet that her threats were empty. Almost immediately
                after a great victory in the Lord, Satan often attacks with
                great success. In this, we must remember that the faith of
                yesterday does not suffice for the need of today. The Child of
                God must ever have a continued deposit of the touch of God, even
                on a daily basis. If Jezebel was so sure of her position, why
                did she not send soldiers to kill Elijah, instead of a messenger
                with the threat? She did not do so, because she feared for the
                life of the soldiers, and even herself. As the fear of Elijah
                was totally unfounded, so is the fear of every other Child of
                God unfounded.)

                Elijah cast his mantle; but, guided by the Holy Spirit, he cast
                it upon a plowboy. How different are Gods thoughts from mans! He
                chose Amos, who was a gatherer of sycamore fruit, and Paul, who
                was not one of the Twelve, and Moody, who was uneducated.

                Ministry.)

                not well have shown. He only asked that he be allowed to go bid
                his parents farewell, which was the right thing for him to do,

                By and large, the sin of the modern Church is little different
                from the sin of Ahaziah. Having opted for the humanistic, even
                atheistic, fallacy of psychology, it has, by and large, forsaken
                the God of the Bible. It has tried to cover its sin by labeling
                its foray into modernism with the term, Christian psychology.
                However, such does not exist. Psychology is not a true science;
                its various methods of treatment are worthy of a Roman circus.
                It has its roots in atheism, evolution, and humanism. It is the
                total opposite of the Bible. Christian psychology, so-called, is
                no different whatsoever from any other type of psychology. The
                name Christian is given to it only to deceive a gullible
                Christian public that has, as well, by and large, forsaken the
                Bible.)

                Divine instrument chosen to execute that judgment; we will find
                that Jehu illustrates how zealous an unconverted man can be for
                God when it suits his personal interests and ambitions to attack
                national evils; what he did on behalf of Righteousness he did
                well and with energy; however, his zeal was carnal; he utterly
                destroyed Baal but permitted the golden calves to remain; this
                fact alone shows that his heart was a stranger to Divine Faith;
                he was an instrument of Gods wrath, carrying out Gods Will, at

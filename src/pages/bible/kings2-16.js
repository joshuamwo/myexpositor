                Basically, Ahaz is saying that he has no more confidence in the
                Word of God. All too often, the modern Church is saying the same
                thing. The Bible has not been completely thrown away; it has

                a whole has turned to psychology. The degradation of the Laver

                Doctrine of Jesus Christ and Him Crucified as the only answer
                for mans sin [

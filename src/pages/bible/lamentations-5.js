                (It may seem that the Book of Lamentations concludes on a very
                negative note. However, the Prophet turns from the fulfillment
                of the Promises at a future day back to the present. Now they
                are utterly rejected. Now the anger of God still burns hot
                against them. This simply says that the present must be dealt
                with before the future can be guaranteed.)

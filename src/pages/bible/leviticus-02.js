                (Inasmuch as part of the Meat Offering was burned in the fire,
                and part eaten by the Priests, we should understand that this
                symbolized Christ in His Perfect Life, but yet a life that would
                be given on the Cross, hence the burning of the Meat Offering on
                the Altar. This signifies, as well, that Christ came to this
                world but for one purpose, and that was to go to the Cross. His
                Life was Perfect, His Demeanor Perfect, His Way Perfect, His
                Manner Perfect, all for the purpose of being a Perfect
                Sacrifice.)

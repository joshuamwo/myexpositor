                this? When we behold man, and the creation of which he was lord,
                laid in ruins at the feet of the enemy, how could we conceive
                that, from amid those ruins, God should gather richer and nobler
                spoils than any which our unfallen world could have yielded?
                Blessed be the Name of Jesus in all of this! It is to Him we owe
                it all. It is by His precious Cross that ever a truth so
                amazing, so Divine, could be enunciated. Assuredly, the Cross
                involved a mysterious wisdom which none of the princes of this
                world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified

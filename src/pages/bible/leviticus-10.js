          the Sin Offering today, should it have been accepted in the sight of
          the LORD?{" "}

                (Concerning this, Ellicott says, But while he, Eleazar, and
                Ithamar were thus duly performing the Sacrificial rites, Nadab
                and Abihu, the other two sons, transgressed, and were suddenly
                struck down dead, thus overwhelming the survivors with sorrow,
                and rendering them unfit to partake of the Sacrifices. Unfitted
                as they thus were by mourning and the sense of their own
                sinfulness, that if they had partaken of this solemn meal it
                would not have been acceptable to the Lord. They were right!)

                (Moses acknowledged Aarons plea to be just, and that he had
                himself spoken hastily. Hence, Jewish tradition ascribed the
                mistake to Moses, not to Aaron. Jewish tradition further says,
                when Moses heard it, he approved of the explanation. Whereupon
                he sent a herald through the whole camp of Israel, saying, It is
                I from whom the Law had been hid, and my brother Aaron brought
                it to my remembrance.)

                which is the outgrowth of true Judaism, there are no
                prohibitions whatsoever of this nature. The reason for these
                particular laws, and the understanding of them, such knowledge
                was not totally necessary, but rather obedience, because Israel
                was a set-apart people, actually raised up for the very purpose
                of bringing Christ the Redeemer into the world. As they were to
                be the womb of the Messiah, so to speak, things which the Lord
                specified as being unclean were forbidden. As stated, they didnt
                have to understand it all, but they definitely must obey. Once
                Christ came, all of these prohibitions ended.)

                make one holy, even as the Sacrifices did not save one. But what

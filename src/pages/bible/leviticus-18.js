                marriage. The positive law of marriage, as implanted in the
                human heart, would be simply that any man of full age might
                marry any woman of full age, provided that both parties were
                willing. But this liberty is at once controlled by a number of
                restrictions, the main purpose of which is to prevent incest,
                which, however much one nation may come to be indifferent to one
                form of it, and other to another, is yet abhorrent to the
                feelings and principles of mankind. The Hebrew restrictive law
                is contained in one Verse, None of you shall approach to any who
                is near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness: I am the

                this world, His Heart was fixed upon God and His Work, with a

                were ever allowed, for a single moment, to come in-between His
                Heart and that Work which He came to do. His Eye was single and
                His heart undivided. This is apparent from the first to the
                last. He could say to His Disciples, I have meat to eat that you
                know not of; and when they, not knowing the deep significance of
                His Words, said Has any man brought Him ought to eat? He
                replied, My meat is to do the Will of Him Who sent Me, and to

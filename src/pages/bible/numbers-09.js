                (Redemption by blood was their foundation and, as well, is the
                foundation also of all Christian experience. It cleanses the
                conscience, restores the soul, and inspires the songs and feasts
                of Canaan. Never in this world, nor in that which is to come,
                will redeemed men reach a degree of holiness that will permit
                them to dispense with the Precious Blood of Christ. The
                indication is, this was the last time they kept the Passover in
                the wilderness, which was a time frame of approximately 40
                years. Considering that there were approximately 3 million
                people, it is not known exactly how they accomplished this
                Passover, considering the river of blood that would have to be
                poured out at the Altar. It is believed it would have taken well
                over 100,000 lambs. All of this tells us that our Salvation

                Prophet in his madness was willing to listen to the voice of the
                Devil, though unwilling to listen to the voice of the Lord. The
                corruption, depravity, and rebellion of mans will is fearfully
                and mysteriously illustrated in Balaam. Even at the time of
                being consciously subject to the Moving of the Holy Spirit, in
                his thirst for money he sought by enchantments to become
                inspired of an Unclean Spirit. So, knowledge of spiritual things

                (The Holy Spirit put these words into Davids mouth the morning
                after his flight from Jerusalem because of Absaloms unnatural
                rebellion. David is seen here as a Type of the Messiah rejected
                by His Own people. Though surrounded by enemies, he slept in
                confidence upon the mountainside beneath Jehovahs sheltering
                wing, and in the assurance of Faith declared that God would lift
                up his head and destroy his foes. So, even though many of these
                Psalms speak of David, they more so speak of our Greater David,
                the Lord Jesus Christ. In other words, David was a Type of
                Christ.)

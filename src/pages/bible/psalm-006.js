          A PSALM OF DAVID: THE INTERCESSORY PRAYER OF CHRIST

                (This is an example of the complete advocacy of Christ in
                Intercession. He, though Himself sinless, declares Himself in
                these Psalms to be the Advocate. And He expresses to God the
                abhorrence of sin, accompanied by the Repentance and sorrow
                which man ought to feel and express, but will not and cannot.
                Similarly, the faith, love, obedience, and worship which man
                fails to give, He perfectly renders.

                Thus, as the High Priest of His People, He, the True Advocate,
                charges Himself with the guilt of our sins, declares them to be
                His Own, confesses them, repents of them, declaring at the same
                time His Own sinlessness, and atones for them. Thus, those
                Psalms in which the speaker declares his sinfulness and his
                sinlessness become quite clear of comprehension when it is
                recognized Who the Speaker is Williams.)

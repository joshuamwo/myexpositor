                Williams says, Only one voice sang this Psalm in perfect tune.
                It was the Voice of Jesus. When walking through the dark valley
                of His earthly Life, Jehovah was His Shepherd. There is no
                suggestion of sin in the Psalm. Its great theme is not so much
                what Jehovah gives, or does, as what or Who He is.

                called the Genesis Book. As Genesis opens with the first Adam in

                first Book of the Psalms opens with the Second Man in blessing
                and closes with His people in affliction. The Pharaoh of Israels
                first affliction [the Book of Exodus] prefigures the Antichrist
                of Israels future and last affliction.)

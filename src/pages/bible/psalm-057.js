                (This was probably written by David when he was being chased by
                Saul, and was in the cave of Engedi. It was one of the most
                critical times in Davids life. The sweet singer of Israel could
                not trust in any man to save him. If he was to be saved, the
                Lord Alone would have to do it; consequently, Davids trust in
                the Lord is overwhelmingly obvious here. It most definitely must
                be a lesson to us.)

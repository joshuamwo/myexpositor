                The doctrine of this and similar Psalms is the perfection of the
                Faith of the Messiah. As Man, He had to undergo every form of
                hatred, affliction, and adversity. The sharper these became, the
                more He trusted. So, His moral glory as the Servant of Jehovah
                shines through all. He voluntarily took upon Himself this
                position of dependence and suffering in union with and on behalf
                of His People.)

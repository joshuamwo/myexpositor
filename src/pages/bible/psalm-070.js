                (The majority of this Psalm is almost identical to Verses 1317
                of Psalm 40. The theme of that in the Fortieth Psalm is the
                Messiahs Personal sufferings in His First Advent; that of this
                Psalm, His sympathetic sufferings with His People immediately
                prior to His Second Advent.)

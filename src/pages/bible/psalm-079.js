                Nebuchadnezzar would take Jerusalem, destroying the Temple; 2.
                It refers to Titus, the Roman General, who destroyed Jerusalem
                and the Temple in A.D. 70; and, 3. It refers to the future
                Temple, which will be defiled by the Antichrist at the midway

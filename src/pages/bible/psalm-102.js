                the Great King are contrasted with His sufferings as the
                Rejected Man. Here, as in so many other Scriptures, His
                sufferings and glories are brought together, and always in that
                order. It was necessary that He should be both the Man of
                Sorrows and the Mighty God. As the One, He is equipped with
                Mercy; as the Other, with Judgment. He is the Afflicted One of

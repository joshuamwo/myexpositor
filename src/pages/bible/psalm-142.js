                overwhelmed within Him, then He was supported by the remembrance
                that God knew His life of sorrow. This implies conscious
                sinlessness. He invited God to scrutinize His conduct from the
                cradle to the Cross. It was a life of constant and bitter trial,
                but it was a sinless life. He was tested daily by snares laid
                for Him, but He never sinned. Men hated Him, but He was
                unspeakably precious to God.)

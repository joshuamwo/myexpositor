                Boaz will prove to be the kinsman redeemer of Ruth. There is one

                to redeem who was a kinsman. Hence, it was necessary that the
                Lord Jesus Christ should become Man in order to redeem man.
                Ruths marriage, and the wealthy home into which she was brought,

                referred to buying back a relatives property and to marrying his
                widow. When a Hebrew was forced to sell his inheritance because
                of poverty, the nearest relative was to redeem it for him [

                without a son, he was obliged to marry the widow. Should he
                refuse to take possession of the property, he was not under
                obligation to marry the widow. Boaz had no right to redeem the
                property until the nearest kinsman refused, which he did.)

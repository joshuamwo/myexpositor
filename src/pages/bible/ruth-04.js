                know if Obed was the immediate father of Jesse, or several times

                great-grandfather, etc. They are all looked at as the father.

                All of this is very important, because it is an integral part of
                the genealogy of King Davids great descendant, his Lord, and
                ours. In other words, it pertains to the Incarnation of Christ,
                God becoming Man, in order to redeem humanity by dying on a
                Cross. Nothing is more important than that!)

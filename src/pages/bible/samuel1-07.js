                (There is much evidence that the Ark was neglected and not at
                all respected. Kirjath-jearim was about eight miles northeast of
                Beth-shemesh. It would remain in this location for approximately
                twenty years, in which time Israel was more or less under the
                yoke of the Philistines. It seems, as well, that it would remain
                there during the forty-year reign of Saul. David would reign
                approximately ten years [seven years in Judah and three years
                over the whole of Israel] before the Ark would be brought to
                Jerusalem. This is a total of approximately seventy years.

                Furthermore, when the Ark was finally found by David, it seems
                that it had been discarded and was standing alone out in a field
                next to the woods. The Psalm of David says, Lo, we heard of it
                at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood [

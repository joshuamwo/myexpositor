                (The Peace Offerings signified the Cross of Jesus, thereby the
                putting to death of self-will. As well, it was the secret of
                power for war as illustrated by Joshuas starting from and
                returning to that center many years before a war in which the
                weapons are spiritual and not carnal. Saul could physically
                accompany Samuel there, and also rejoice greatly, and yet remain
                a stranger, as we shall see, to the real and inward significance
                of the place.)

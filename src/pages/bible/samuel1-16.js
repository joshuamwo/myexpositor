                and the success of one and the failure of the other. Quite
                possibly, the attendants of Saul had learned the value of
                consecrated music from Samuel.)

                (Williams says, God did not at once set David upon the throne as
                He had done in the case of Saul. He had first to be tested, and
                humbled, and made to feel his dependence on God, and the
                sufficiency of God to uphold him and maintain him. Hence, at the
                outset of his career, he is brought face-to-face with Satan. So
                was it with the Blessed One, of Whom David was a Type. His
                public life began with an encounter with the Devil. It was thus,
                and by his subsequent sufferings, that David was molded and
                trained to be the channel through which the Psalms were given to
                the world.)

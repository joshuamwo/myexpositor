                [Cain and Abel], and will not cease until the Trump of God
                sounds. The biggest enemy to the Work of God is religion, which
                is a product of the flesh. Thats where Satan does his best and
                most destructive work. [Religion is a concoction of man,
                designed to reach God, or to better ones self in someway. In any
                form it is unacceptable to God.])

                recorded to lead to the belief that his public or private
                conduct was unworthy of a man and a king; and men would have
                little known that there were such depths of malignity in his
                character had David never appeared. Davids person and victories
                made manifest Sauls true character.

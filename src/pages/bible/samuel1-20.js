                David, with a part of that leadership, who is Jonathan,
                accepting him, this portrays the highest of Israel rejecting the
                Lord Jesus Christ, with part of its leadership accepting Him;
                however, as Jonathan, the small part of the leadership which did
                accept Christ [Joseph of Arimathaea and Nicodemus] had very
                little influence on the decision of the hierarchy. In this
                instance, David was, and is, a Type of the true King of Israel,
                now rejected and hated by the world. But just as the kingdom
                came ultimately to David, and just as he gave high positions in
                that kingdom to those who had loved him when an outcast, so will
                Christ the Lord ultimately receive the dominion of the Earth,
                and He will appoint to great honor those who now love and follow
                Him.)

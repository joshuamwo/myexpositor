                (We learn at least two great truths in this Chapter: 1. The
                great lengths that Saul will go to in order to kill David. Saul
                is a type of apostate religion that must kill, or at least
                attempt to kill, that which is of God, of which David is a Type;
                and, 2. The great reluctance that David will have to harm Saul.
                This portrays the true Child of God, who will not take matters
                into his own hands, but will place all in the Hands of the
                Lord.)

                believes. The Child of God must be careful that he does not read

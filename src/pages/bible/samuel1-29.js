                were regarding the events of this Chapter. We can only form
                conclusions according to that which the Holy Spirit gives us.
                This was not a high point of Davids life to date. Actually, it
                would be the lowest and most wretched to this moment. It would
                seem that he would profess himself ready and eager to fight
                against Gods beloved People, and to help Satan destroy them! He
                told many lies to Achish, the king of the Philistines, but the
                lie of this Chapter was the crowning lie to date. He professed
                devotion to the Philistine monarch, while, no doubt, rejoicing
                secretly at escaping from so dreadful a position. All of this
                shows how deeply a Child of God can fall when he leans upon the
                hand of man, and not upon the Hand of God.)

                (Concerning this, Williams says, The path of faith is wearying
                to nature; and there is an ever-present temptation to seek ease
                from the thorns through which that path sometimes leads. The
                persecution by professors of religion has oftentimes the effect
                of throwing the servant of God into the arms of the enemies of
                God; just as Sauls hatred drove David to the Philistines. But
                this only happens when the Christian follows his own will, and
                thinks, by doing so, to avoid the very difficulties which, had
                he walked with God, would have become channels of teaching and
                refreshment to his soul. The more glorious a work there is for
                faith, the more sure is nature to weary if faith grows feeble.)

                (It should always be remembered that failure, despite the Grace
                of God, always, and without exception, carries with it its own
                punishment even more in the life of the one who has been grandly
                touched by the Holy Spirit. Too often Christendom reads only
                perfection into the life of Gods champions; however, they do so
                by ignoring the Word of God. The individual is never called by
                God because he meets Gods requirements. Actually, he never does.
                Always, he is woefully unprepared, immature, and lacking in
                proper faith. It is the Work of the Holy Spirit, among other
                things, to bring David, and others like him, to the place of
                maturity that God desires. It does not come easily. A great call
                always demands a great test.

                Sooner or later, there will be failure; it is inevitable. It may
                not be known all the time to the general Christian public, but
                God knows. It is a part of the growing process. Regrettably,
                oftentimes one learns more from the failures than one does from
                the victories. The reason should be obvious. At times, faith
                shines brighter during failure than during victory, the reason
                being the pressure applied. Faith will either rise to the
                occasion, or else quit. True men of God may fail, but they do
                not quit.)

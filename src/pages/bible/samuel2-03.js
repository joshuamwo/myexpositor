                (Abner was related to Ish-bosheth as Joab was to David. Joab was
                clever, ambitious, bloodthirsty, and heartless. He was an
                ungodly man who deemed it politically correct to effect a zeal
                for God [

                ]. In fact, Abner was morally superior to Joab; but yet Abner
                was a traitor to his master and a rebel to his God. He had no
                real heart for David as Gods king, but was moved to help him by
                wounded pride. He reaped as he sowed; however, and as stated,
                his reaping did not absolve Joab of blame.)

                (As stated, Ahithophel was Bath-shebas grandfather. Why in the
                world did he do what he was doing? Why did he have such a hatred
                for David, who, in fact, had given him everything that he
                presently had? Considering that this man was perhaps the wisest
                man in Israel, he should have known better.

                To every great gift there is a drawback. Ahithophel obviously
                trusted his own wisdom instead of looking to the Lord for
                guidance. As wise as he was, he simply wasnt wise enough, and
                neither is any other man.)

                course, all sin is heinous in the eyes of God, and is actually
                directed against Him. The difference is the following: Davids
                sin was a sin of passion, with the murder of Uriah an effort to
                cover-up the sin. Absaloms sin had as its fountain the sin of
                Satan himself in his rebellion against God. In other words,
                Absalom entered into Satans rebellion. It was a far more heinous
                sin than his father Davids; however, most of the Church world
                does not see it that way, but actually would join Absalom,
                because outwardly it looks so right.

                Davids sin was not joined by anyone else, whereas Absaloms sin
                was joined by the majority of Israel. In other words, they
                became associates with his sin, which, in fact, threatened the
                very foundation of Israels existence.

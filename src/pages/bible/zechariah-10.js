                time, and even before, still, its basic and plenary fulfillment
                awaits the future. Ask you of the Lord rain in the time of the

                Jeremiah, the promised Latter Rain was withheld and the harvests
                were, therefore, sparse. Consequently, the Holy Spirit is saying
                that, had Israel not turned aside to idols, they would have
                received the early rain and the latter rain and would not have
                been carried away into captivity.

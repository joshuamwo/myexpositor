                A true sense of sin and guilt in relationship to God awakens the
                sense of the need of cleansing, and so the shed and cleansing
                Blood of the Lamb of God becomes precious to convicted
                conscience. As well, the ever-living efficacy of Christs Atoning
                Work, with its power to cleanse the conscience and the life, is
                justly comparable to a fountain and not to a font. The sense of

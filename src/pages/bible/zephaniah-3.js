                through the remainder of the Chapter, the Restoration of Israel
                is promised. It was a Restoration they could have had at the
                First Advent of Christ, but brutally refused by murdering their
                Messiah. When they finally do accept Christ, which will be
                immediately after the Second Coming, there will be great joy in
                Israel.)
